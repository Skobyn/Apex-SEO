# Apex MCP Server - Project Recap

## Overview
This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on Cloudflare Workers. The MCP allows external tools to provide additional context to AI assistants like Claude. 

## Fixed Issues

1. **Fixed Type Compatibility Issues**:
   - Created a custom type override file (`src/types/overrides.d.ts`) to handle compatibility issues between Cloudflare Workers types and standard DOM types
   - Fixed the `Headers` and `Response` type conflicts by using type assertions
   - Added missing `finished` property to `AbortSignal` interface

2. **Fixed Environment Variables**:
   - Added missing `CONTEXT_DATA` KV namespace in the `Env` interface
   - Updated the wrangler.toml configuration to include both KV namespaces

3. **Fixed API/Type Definition Mismatches**:
   - Added missing properties `name` and `parameters` to the `ToolCallRequest` interface
   - Added appropriate type assertions for function parameters in tool handlers

4. **Fixed Duplicate Function Declarations**:
   - Renamed duplicated functions `getKeywordsData` to `getKeywordsDataAdvanced`
   - Renamed duplicated functions `getBacklinks` to `getBacklinksAdvanced`
   - Updated all references to these functions across the codebase

5. **Fixed Configuration Conflicts**:
   - Resolved the conflict between `node_compat` and `compatibility_flags` in wrangler.toml

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/handlers/`: API endpoint handlers
- `src/services/`: External API integration
- `src/tools/`: Tool definitions and execution
- `src/types/`: Type definitions
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions

## Deployment
The server can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers using the following commands:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run locally
npx wrangler dev

# Deploy to Cloudflare
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Next Steps
1. Complete integration with DataForSEO API
2. Add proper error handling and logging
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Create a client library to interact with the MCP server
5. Document all available endpoints and tools

## Project Overview

We've been building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with DataForSEO APIs to provide AI assistants like Claude with real-time SEO data capabilities. The server implements the MCP protocol over SSE (Server-Sent Events) and is deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

## What's Been Completed

1. **Architecture Design**
   - Created a modular architecture that separates concerns
   - Designed a scalable system that can be extended with new APIs
   - Implemented the MCP protocol over SSE streaming

2. **Core Components Implemented**
   - MCP Protocol Implementation (Stream Handler, Tool Discovery, Tool Call Handler)
   - DataForSEO API Services integration
   - Tool Registry with parameter validation
   - Cloudflare KV Storage Layer for persistence

3. **Test Client**
   - Built an HTML test client for verifying server functionality
   - Implemented connection, tool discovery, tool calling, and context submission

4. **Documentation**
   - Created architecture documentation
   - Documented the server's core components and scalability considerations

## Current State

- The server code is implemented and can be run locally
- The basic MCP protocol implementation is in place
- DataForSEO API integration is functional
- The server can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers

## Next Steps

1. **Cloudflare Worker Configuration**
   - Create a KV namespace for data storage
   - Configure wrangler.toml with environment variables

2. **Setup GitHub Integration**
   - Store secrets in GitHub repository
   - Configure GitHub Actions for deployment
   - Setup CI/CD pipeline

3. **Credentials Required**
   - Cloudflare Account ID
   - Cloudflare API Token
   - DataForSEO Username
   - DataForSEO API Key

4. **KV Namespace Setup**
   - Create a KV namespace with `wrangler kv:namespace create "MCP_STORAGE"`
   - Use the generated namespace ID in wrangler.toml

5. **Deployment Process**
   - Update wrangler.toml with the correct configuration
   - Deploy the server to Cloudflare Workers
   - Test the deployed server with the test client

6. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement authentication for securing endpoints
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
   - Add monitoring and analytics

## Wrangler Configuration

Create a `wrangler.toml` file with the following content:

```toml
name = "apex-mcp"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2023-12-01"

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "MCP_STORAGE", id = "your-namespace-id-here" }
]

[vars]
DATAFORSEO_USERNAME = ""  # Will be replaced during deployment
DATAFORSEO_API_KEY = ""   # Will be replaced during deployment
```

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - name: Publish to Cloudflare
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          KV_NAMESPACE_ID: ${{ secrets.KV_NAMESPACE_ID }}
          DATAFORSEO_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DATAFORSEO_USERNAME }}
          DATAFORSEO_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DATAFORSEO_API_KEY }}
```

## Importance of KV Namespace

The KV namespace serves as the database for the MCP server, enabling it to:
- Store client connection states
- Save context data submitted by AI assistants
- Cache DataForSEO API results
- Track active sessions and tool calls

Without this persistent storage, the Worker would be completely stateless and unable to maintain the information needed for the MCP protocol to function properly.
