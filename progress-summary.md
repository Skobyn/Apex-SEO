# Apex MCP Server - Progress Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server on Cloudflare Workers. The MCP allows external tools to provide additional context to AI assistants like Claude. The server implementation includes:

- SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoints for real-time communication
- Context submission and storage using Cloudflare KV
- Tool discovery and execution endpoints
- Integration with DataForSEO API for SEO-related tools

## Actions Taken
1. Attempted to build the project with `npm run build`
2. Identified multiple TypeScript errors in the codebase
3. Created a simplified version of the main `index.ts` file to handle core functionality
4. Tested the build with the simplified implementation

## Current Issues

### Build Errors
The project currently has TypeScript compilation errors, including:

1. **Type compatibility issues with Cloudflare Workers Response type**:
   - The `Headers` type from Cloudflare Workers is missing the `getSetCookie` method that's required in the standard DOM `Headers` type
   - This affects multiple handler files (`discovery.ts`, `stream.ts`, `utils/cors.ts`)

2. **Missing environment variables**:
   - Property `CONTEXT_DATA` not found on type `Env`
   - Files affected: `health.ts`, `stream.ts`

3. **API/Type definition mismatches**:
   - Missing properties `name` and `parameters` on type `ToolCallRequest`
   - Function signature incompatibilities in route handlers

4. **Duplicate function declarations**:
   - Multiple declarations of `getKeywordsData` and `getBacklinks` in `services/dataforseo.ts`

### File Structure Issues
Attempted to remove old files using `rm -rf` but encountered PowerShell parameter error (Windows environment).

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix type compatibility issues**:
   - Update the `Env` interface to include all required environment variables
   - Implement type augmentation to resolve Cloudflare Workers vs standard DOM type conflicts
   - Create custom type definitions for all request/response objects

2. **Clean up the codebase**:
   - Remove or rename duplicate function declarations
   - Properly structure the project to avoid file path conflicts

3. **Project organization**:
   - Use Windows-compatible commands for file operations (`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force path/to/directory`)
   - Consider implementing a modular architecture using explicit imports rather than global types

4. **Integration testing**:
   - Once build errors are resolved, test the server locally using Wrangler
   - Verify all endpoints work as expected (stream, context submission, tool execution)

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with setup and deployment instructions
   - Document the API endpoints and their usage

## Technical Debt Notes
- The project mixes global type augmentation with explicit interfaces
- Some service functions have duplicate implementations with different signatures
- Error handling could be more consistent across handlers

## Resources
- The project uses TypeScript 5.0.4 and Cloudflare Workers types 4.20231025.0
- Authentication for DataForSEO is handled via environment variables
- `itty-router` is included as a dependency but not currently utilized in the simplified implementation
